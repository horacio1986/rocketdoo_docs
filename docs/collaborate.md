# How to Collaborate on This Project?

This project was created with more passion and dedication to providing a valuable tool for Odoo developers than with advanced Python programming skills.

Therefore, any suggestions for improvements or contributions to the functionalities of this framework are not only welcome but highly encouraged. We invite anyone willing to contribute to help **ROCKETDOO** grow and thrive.

---

To contribute improvements to the **ROCKETDOO** repository, you must first create a FORK of the repo. All contributions should then be made in a new branch that clearly describes the change you intend to make, following branch naming conventions and best practices. Specifically, use prefixes to indicate the type of change:

Examples:

* **FEAT:** (for new features)  
* **UPD:** (for upgrades or updates)  
* **FIX:** (to fix bugs)  
* **WIP:** (work in progress)  
* **DEL:** (to remove functionality or code)  

And so on, depending on the nature of the change.

Once your changes are complete, create a commit with a clear description and then open a Pull Request (PR).

The PR will be reviewed, and if approved, merged into the *develop* branch for testing. After successful testing and approval, it will be merged into the *main* branch.
