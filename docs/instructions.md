# Instructions for Use

In this section of the documentation, we will prepare our computer to start developing in Odoo using  
**ROCKETDOO**.

***For developers who prefer to work with Windows and WSL2, as mentioned on the previous page, your system should already be ready with all the initial tools installed.***

For those working on Linux-based operating systems, we will outline the essential tools you need to have installed before getting started.

## Tools required before Rocketdoo

1. Keep your Linux packages up to date.
2. Ensure Git is installed or check if it is already installed:

~~~
git --version
~~~

Or install it:

~~~
sudo apt install git -y
~~~

3. Have Visual Studio Code installed.  
4. Ensure Pythonâ€™s package manager `pip` is installed.  
5. Install Docker and Docker Compose using the official guide shared in the **Get Started** page.  
6. Install the basic VSCode extensions:
    - Docker
    - Dev Container

And most importantly, install the ROCKETDOO library:

~~~
