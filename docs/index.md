# Welcome to ROCKETDOO

![rocketdoo-welcome](img/banner.png)

Rocketdoo is a framework developed in Python, which aims to provide a fast and efficient development environment.

With Rocketdoo, you will be able to deploy in simple steps one or several environments to develop in Odoo, in all its editions and versions;
You will be able to develop new modules or new functionalities for the Enterprise edition as well as for the Community edition.


## Overview

This tool was designed for developers who are new to Odoo development, as well as for more experienced developers who are looking to deploy
their environments and then just focus on creating new modules,
and/or functionalities.
It is important to emphasize that it is a tool, therefore it can be of great utility as we also know that there are several methods to be able
to perform the task of developing in Odoo. With this we want to clarify that it is not
neither the only tool nor the most recommended to develop in Odoo; it is simply one more tool, that seeks to contribute and cover all the
needs that we consider useful to be able to approach a development, and at the same time, to optimize and
automate the time of a developer.
We know that the ERP-ODOO is a wide system, of great scope and magnitude, that depending on the client, the need,
the localization to be used in the system; it is necessary to contemplate a series of requirements that go beyond the
own requirement of development requested.
This extra of requirements can be, from necessary libraries in python, as well as dependencies in the programming language,
dependencies for the functionality of a module, third party repositories needed to be able to successfully
approach a development.
All this set of packages and needs we consider that many times are a real headache for every developer.

It is because of this and many other things that the idea of developing an automated and intuitive environment to serve each developer or development teams was born, alleviating the task of launching a development and offering the relevant
approach for a developer, which is to focus on developing a new module or functionality.

## Description

To further understand what Rocketdoo is and how to use it correctly, we will give a brief description of the tools that are needed as well as how to use them.

First of all we must mention that Rocketdoo was developed and thought to create development environments in the Linux operating system, in its different 
Linux operating system, in its different distros; such as Ubuntu or Debian.
We consider that it is the appropriate system to be able to work with this framework for the following reasons
below.

Rocketdoo, uses the following tools to perform its task:

* Docker and Docker Compose.
* Git and Github or any version control manager.
* SSH key for private repository management.
* Gitman.
* Python and its package manager pip.
* Use of a CLI terminal.
* Visual Studio Code.
* Necessary extensions of Visual Studio Code (later we will list the recommended extensions).

This list of necessary tools and even more the Docker tool and Docker Compose are the ones that determine that we consider using Rocketdoo.
on a Linux operating system.

However, we are aware that many programmers prefer to use Windows as their operating system, and for this we recommend using almost exclusively
the Linux Subsystem on Windows in its version 2 **WSL2**.
